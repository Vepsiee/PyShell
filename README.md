# PyShell OSVER

***WINDOWS MAY MARK THE EXECUTABLE AS UNSAFE, I HAVE SUBMITTED A FORM AND YOU CAN CHECK THE PYTHON FILE TO MAKE SURE IT IS SAFE.***

***THIS IS NOT A RAT, THIS IS A "TERMINAL" FOR AN OPERATING SYSTEM***

***Renamed the repo as most PyShell results would be "Python RAT" or something like that.***

A "terminal", but in python.
